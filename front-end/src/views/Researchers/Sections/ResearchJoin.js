                  An <b>Expression of Interest (EOI)</b> process has been designed to help manage sub-study proposals. 
                  The invitation to collaborate and utilise the CAPRI-database is open to early-career and 
                  senior researchers, clinicians who may wish to partner in research activity as well as 
                  PhD students and potential PhD candidates looking to examine a specific area of physiotherapy.

                  We encourage clinicians, researchers, PhD students, potential funders and others 
                  to submit an EOI sub-study proposal. Both national and international investigators 
                  are welcomed. EOI submissions will be subject to scientific review by the CAPRI 
                  Project Steering Committee to ensure quality, rigour, fit and other important criteria.
